## Slide 4
- Composite Materials: Key Advantages for Military Applications
- The advanced composites used by ACC SRL deliver decisive advantages over traditional steel or aluminum structures, fundamentally transforming modern naval fleet capabilities.
- Significantly Reduced Weight
- Up to 60% lighter than their metallic equivalents, directly translating into higher speed, outstanding maneuverability, extended range, and drastically lower fuel consumption—major long-term operational savings.
- Superior Multidimensional Strength
- Exceptional impact performance, total resistance to corrosion in saline marine environments, and superior fatigue resistance. Our composites preserve structural integrity even in the harshest operating scenarios.
- Advanced Stealth Capabilities
- Dramatically reduced radar signature, virtually eliminated magnetic signature, and minimized infrared footprint. These traits deliver a decisive tactical edge in special operations and sensitive missions.
- Long-Term Durability and Economy
- Maintenance costs reduced by up to 70% compared with metal structures. Extended service life without significant degradation results in a far lower total cost of ownership.
